# Hello World
This is a happy little folder where I keep all my happy little things.

## Happy little todo
* [x] Check to see if nb's can be pinned to a position by logic only
  * Sadly, no. Seems to be synced through server logic.
* [ ] Check to see if deliveries can be linked to camps by logic only
  * Seems to be based on distance units in float, no static connection.
  * Maybe add way to calculate corresponding sales missions based on distance units later?
* [ ] Check to see if FMEs would be useful to display in full (only co-op stuff!)
  * [x] Get spawns & info for Trade Route.
  * [ ] Get spawns & info for Manhunt.
* [x] Format all `WORLD_SCENARIO` static spawns and maybe put them on the map (tons of markers, 100k+ likely)
  * [ ] Add option to hide spawns that aren't active based on clock
  * [ ] Add display for the specific animal if available instead of grouping
  * [ ] Add option to remove/hide spawns
* [ ] Bounty Hunter missions
  * [x] Bounty boards
  * [x] Hideout
  * [x] Known Target
  * [ ] Known Target - Moving
  * [x] Lure
  * [x] Stakeout
  * [x] Timed
  * [ ] Track
  * [ ] Track - Multi
  * [ ] Integrate to map, and check if proto's are correct...
